may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions.
Those are as fixed as fate; and my voyage is only now
delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.
The winter has been dreadfully severe; but the spring
promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early
season; so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected.
I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to
confide in my prudence and considerateness, whenever the
safety of others is committed to my care.

I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near
prospect of my undertaking. It is impossible to communicate
to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half
pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to
depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the land of
mist and snow”; but I shall kill no albatross, therefore do
not be alarmed for my safety, or if I should come back to
you as worn and woful as the “Ancient Mariner”? You
will smile at my allusion; but I will disclose a secret. I
have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate
enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean, to that
production of the most imaginative of modern poets.
There is something at work in my soul, which I do not
understand. I am practically industrious--pains-taking;--a
workman to execute with perseverance and labour:--but
besides this, there is a love for the marvellous, a
belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which
hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to
the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore.

But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet
you again, after having traversed immense seas, and
returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America?
I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look
on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present
to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive
your letters on some occasions when I need them
most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly.
Remember me with affection, should you never hear from
me again.

 Your affectionate brother,

 Robert Walton.
