cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,
when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent
them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her
endeavours to make us forget.

The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval
spent the last evening with us. He had endeavoured to
persuade his father to permit him to accompany me, and to
become my fellow student; but in vain. His father was a
narrow-minded trader, and saw idleness and ruin in the

myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such
were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as
I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired
the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,
thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in
one place, and had longed to enter the world, and take my
