the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall
again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your
kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would
spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes--who has
no thought nor sense of joy, except as it is mirrored also
in your dear countenances--who would fill the air with
blessings, and spend his life in serving you--he bids
you weep--to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes,
if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction
pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your
sad torments!

Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror,
and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow
upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless
victims to my unhallowed arts.

CHAPTER IX.

Nothing is more painful to the human mind, than, after
the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of
events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which
follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.
Justine died; she rested; and I was alive. The blood
flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse
pressed on my heart, which nothing could remove.
Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit,
for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description
horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself), was
yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness, and
the love of virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions,
and thirsted for the moment when I should put
them in practice, and make myself useful to my fellow-beings.
Now all was blasted: instead of that serenity of
conscience, which allowed me to look back upon the past
with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise
of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of
guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures,
such as no language can describe.
