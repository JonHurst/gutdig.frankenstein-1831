CHAPTER XXII.

The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to
Paris. I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength, and
that I must repose before I could continue my journey.
My father’s care and attentions were indefatigable; but he
did not know the origin of my sufferings, and sought erroneous
methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me
to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man.
Oh, not abhorred! they were my brethren, my fellow beings,
and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them,
as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism.
But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse. I
had unchained an enemy among them, whose joy it was to
shed their blood, and to revel in their groans. How they
would, each and all, abhor me, and hunt me from the world,
did they know my unhallowed acts, and the crimes which
had their source in me!

My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society,
and strove by various arguments to banish my despair.
Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of
being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured
to prove to me the futility of pride.

“Alas! my father,” said I, “how little do you know
me. Human beings, their feelings and passions, would
indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine,
poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she
suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the
cause of this--I murdered her. William, Justine, and
Henry--they all died by my hands.”

My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me
make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he
sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he
appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and
that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented
itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which
I preserved in my convalescence. I avoided explanation,
