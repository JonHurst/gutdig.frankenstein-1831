tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they
might not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but
still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until,
giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept
aloud.

But this was not the time for delay: I disencumbered
the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful
portion of food; and, after an hour’s rest, which was absolutely
necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to
me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible;
nor did I again lose sight of it, except at the moments
when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its
intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it; and
when, after nearly two days’ journey, I beheld my enemy at
no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.

But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my
foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost
all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before.
A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as
the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every
moment more ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in
vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the
mighty shock of an earthquake, it split, and cracked with a
tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon
finished: in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between
me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered
piece of ice, that was continually lessening, and thus preparing
for me a hideous death.

In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of
my dogs died; and I myself was about to sink under the
accumulation of distress, when I saw your vessel riding at
anchor, and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.
I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north, and
was astounded at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of
my sledge to construct oars; and by these means was enabled,
with infinite fatigue, to move my ice-raft in the direction
of your ship. I had determined, if you were going
southward, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas
rather than abandon my purpose. I hoped to induce you
to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy.
