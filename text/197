revenge, will I again behold the sun, and tread the green
herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead; and
on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct
me in my work. Let the cursed and hellish monster
drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now
torments me.”

I had begun my adjuration with solemnity, and an awe
which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered
friends heard and approved my devotion; but the furies
possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.

I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud

Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he
still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track. Sometimes
the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed
me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared
that if I lost all trace of him, I should despair and die, left
some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my
