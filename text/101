confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I
felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were,
and that I ought to render him happy before I complained
of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply
with his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended
the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain
again began to descend: we entered the hut, the fiend with
an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart, and depressed
spirits. But I consented to listen; and, seating myself by
the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus
began his tale.

CHAPTER XI.

â€œIt is with considerable difficulty that I remember the
original era of my being: all the events of that period appear
confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of
sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt, at
the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I
learned to distinguish between the operations of my various
senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed
upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes.
Darkness then came over me, and troubled me; but hardly
had I felt this, when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose,
the light poured in upon me again. I walked, and,
I believe, descended; but I presently found a great alteration
in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies
had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but
I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no
obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The

and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my
fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This
roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some
berries which I found hanging on the trees, or lying on the
