renders them more necessary beings. If our impulses were
confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly
free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows, and
a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.

 We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
 We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.
 We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
 Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
 It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,

 Nought may endure but mutability!

It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the
ascent. For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks
the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the surrounding
mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the
cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is
very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending
low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The
field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly
two hours in crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare
perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood

which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something
like joy; I exclaimed--“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye
wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me
this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away
from the joys of life.”

As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at
some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman
speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among
which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he
approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled:
a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me;
but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.
I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and
