mildness of his discipline. This circumstance, added to his
well known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very
desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my
best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage,
has so refined the groundwork of my character, that I cannot
overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised
on board ship: I have never believed it to be
necessary; and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for
his kindliness of heart, and the respect and obedience paid
to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in
being able to secure his services. I heard of him first in
rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him
the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story.

He had already bought a farm with his money, on which
he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he
bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains
of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited
the young woman's father to consent to her marriage
with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking
himself bound in honour to my friend; who, when he
found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned
until he heard that his former mistress was married
according to her inclinations. "What a noble fellow!"
you will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated:
he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant
carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct
the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and
sympathy which otherwise he would command.

Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little, or
because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I
