Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun
declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a
gentle breeze, and the sea became free from breakers. But
these gave place to a heavy swell: I felt sick, and hardly
able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high
land towards the south.

Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue, and the dreadful
suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty
of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and
tears gushed from my eyes.

How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that
clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery! I
constructed another sail with a part of my dress, and eagerly
steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and
rocky appearance; but, as I approached nearer, I easily
perceived the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the
shore, and found myself suddenly transported back to the
neighbourhood of civilised man. I carefully traced the
windings of the land, and hailed a steeple which I at length
saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in
a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards
the town, as a place where I could most easily procure
nourishment. Fortunately I had money with me. As I
turned the promontory, I perceived a small neat town and
a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with
joy at my unexpected escape.

As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the
sails, several people crowded towards the spot. They seemed
much surprised at my appearance; but, instead of offering
me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that
at any other time might have produced in me a slight
sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that
they spoke English; and I therefore addressed them in that
language: "My good friends," said I, "will you be so
kind as to tell me the name of this town, and inform me
where I am?"

"You will know that soon enough," replied a man
with a hoarse voice. "May be you are come to a place that
will not prove much to your taste; but you will not be
consulted as to your quarters, I promise you."
