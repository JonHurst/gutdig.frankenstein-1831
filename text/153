 ----"The sounding cataract
 Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,
 The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
 Their colours and their forms, were then to him
 An appetite; a feeling, and a love,
 That had no need of a remoter charm,
 By thought supplied, or any interest
 Unborrow'd from the eye"[3]

And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely
being lost for ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas,
imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a
world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;--has
this mind perished? Does it now only exist in my
memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought,
and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still
visits and consoles your unhappy friend.

Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are
but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry,
but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish
which his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my
tale.

Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland;
and we resolved to post the remainder of our way; for the
wind was contrary, and the stream of the river was too
gentle to aid us.

Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful
scenery; but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence
we proceeded by sea to England. It was on a clear morning,
in the latter days of December, that I first saw the
white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented
a new scene; they were flat, but fertile, and almost
every town was marked by the remembrance of some story.
We saw Tilbury Fort, and remembered the Spanish armada;
Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich, places which
I had heard of even in my country.

At length we saw the numerous steeples of London,
St. Paul's towering above all, and the Tower famed in
English history.
