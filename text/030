gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he
speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,
yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.

He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually
on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge
that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not
so utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he interests
himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently
conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated
to him without disguise. He entered attentively into all
my arguments in favour of my eventual success, and into
every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure

stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of
repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore
his composure.

Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared
to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and
quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to
converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the
history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told:
