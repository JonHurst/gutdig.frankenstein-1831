She is to be tried to-day, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that
she will be acquitted.”

This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my
own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was
guiltless of this murder. I had no fear, therefore, that any
circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong

madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except

in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew
that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced
in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.”
She wept.

“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If
she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our
