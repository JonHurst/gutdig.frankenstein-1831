CHAPTER V.

It was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld the
accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost
amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life
around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the
lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in

my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
But it was in vain: I slept, indeed, but I was
disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth,
