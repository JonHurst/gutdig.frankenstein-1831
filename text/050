remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies, and
to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself
to possess a natural talent. On the same day, I paid M.
Waldman a visit. His manners in private were even more
mild and attractive than in public; for there was a certain
dignity in his mien during his lecture, which in his own
house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.
I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former
pursuits as I had given to his fellow-professor. He heard
with attention the little narration concerning my studies,
and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus,
but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited.
He said, that "these were men to whose indefatigable
zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most
of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to
us, as an easier task, to give new names, and arrange in
connected classifications, the facts which they in a great
degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The
labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed,
scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage
of mankind." I listened to his statement, which was
delivered without any presumption or affectation; and
then added, that his lecture had removed my prejudices
against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured
terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth
to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in
life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm
which stimulated my intended labours. I requested his
advice concerning the books I ought to procure.

"I am happy," said M. Waldman, "to have gained a
disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have
no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of
natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have
been and may be made: it is on that account that I have
made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have
not neglected the other branches of science. A man would
make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department
of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to
become really a man of science, and not merely a petty
