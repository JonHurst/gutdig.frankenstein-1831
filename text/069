benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D--n the fellow!”
cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript
us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.
A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius
Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself
at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled
down, we shall all be out of countenance. – Ay, ay,” continued
he, observing my face expressive of suffering, “M.
Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young
man. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you
know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young; but that
wears out in a very short time.”

M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself,
which happily turned the conversation from a subject that
was so annoying to me.

Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural
science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those
which had occupied me. He came to the university with
the design of making himself complete master of the oriental
languages, as thus he should open a field for the plan of life
he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no
inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as
affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian,
Arabic, and Sanscrit languages engaged his attention, and
I was easily induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness
had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly
from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great
relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found
not only instruction but consolation in the works of the
orientalists. I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge
of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making
any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read
merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid
my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy
elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the
authors of any other country. When you read their writings,
life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of
roses, – in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the
fire that consumes your own heart. How different from
the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!
