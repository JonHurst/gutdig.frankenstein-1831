of mind which I had endured. For a short space of time I
remained at the window, watching the pallid lightnings that
played above Mont Blanc, and listening to the rushing of
the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same
lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations:
when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over
me; I felt it as it came, and blest the giver of oblivion.

CHAPTER X.

I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I
stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their
rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down
from the summit of the hills, to barricade the valley. The
abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy
wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines
were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only
by the brawling waves, or the fall of some vast fragment,
the thunder sound of the avalanche, or the cracking, reverberated
along the mountains of the accumulated ice, which,
through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and
anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their
hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded
me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.
They elevated me from all littleness of feeling; and although
they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillised
it. In some degree, also, they diverted my mind
from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last
month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,
waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand
shapes which I had contemplated during the day. They
congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top,
the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare
ravine; the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds--they all
gathered round me, and bade me be at peace.

Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?
