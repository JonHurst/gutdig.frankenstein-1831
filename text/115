raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark,
but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular
proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek
tinged with a lovely pink.

"Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her,
every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly
expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could
hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his
cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought
him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by
different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes,
she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously,
and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet
Arabian. She did not appear to understand him, but
smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her
guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation
took place between him and his father; and the young
stranger knelt at the old man's feet, and would have kissed
his hand, but he raised her, and embraced her affectionately.

"I soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered
articulate sounds, and appeared to have a language of her
own, she was neither understood by, nor herself understood,
the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not
comprehend; but I saw that her presence diffused gladness
through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates
the morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy,
and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha,
the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger;
and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared
to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she
came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,
expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.
Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence
of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that
she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea
instantly occurred to me, that I should make use of the
same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned
about twenty words at the first lesson, most of them, indeed,
were those which I had before understood, but I profited by
the others.
