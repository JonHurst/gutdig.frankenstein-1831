utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications
and impediments that seemed to keep human beings
from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly
I had repined.

But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated
deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that
they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear
strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century;
but while I followed the routine of education in the schools
of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard
to my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and
I was left to struggle with a child's blindness, added to a
student's thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my
new preceptors, I entered with the greatest diligence into
the search of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life;
but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.
Wealth was an inferior object; but what glory would attend
the discovery, if I could banish disease from the
human frame, and render man invulnerable to any but a
violent death!

Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts
or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite
authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and
if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the
failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake, than to
a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for
a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like
an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories, and floundering
desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge,
guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning,
till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.

When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our
house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and
terrible thunder-storm. It advanced from behind the
mountains of Jura; and the thunder burst at once with
frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I
remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress
with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a
sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and
beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards from our
