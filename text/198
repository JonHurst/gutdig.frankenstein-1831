head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white
plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new,
and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have
felt, and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were the
least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed
by some devil, and carried about with me my eternal hell;
yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps;
and, when I most murmured, would suddenly extricate me
from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,
when nature, overcome by hunger, sunk under the exhaustion,
a repast was prepared for me in the desert, that
restored and inspirited me. The fare was, indeed, coarse,
such as the peasants of the country ate; but I will not
doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked

guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours,
of happiness, that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage.
Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk
under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and
inspirited by the hope of night: for in sleep I saw my
friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw
the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver
tones of my Elizabeth's voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying
