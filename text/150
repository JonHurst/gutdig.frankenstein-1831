feeling haunted me, which filled me with fear and agitation.
During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious
of the existence of their enemy, and unprotected from his
attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure. But
he had promised to follow me wherever I might go; and
would he not accompany me to England? This imagination
was dreadful in itself, but soothing, inasmuch as it supposed

they endured.

After some days spent in listless indolence, during which
I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I
waited two days for Clerval. He came. Alas, how great
was the contrast between us! He was alive to every new
scene; joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun,
