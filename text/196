and calm, at periods when otherwise delirium or death
would have been my portion.

My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my
country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear
to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided
myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels
which had belonged to my mother, and departed.

And now my wanderings began, which are to cease but
with life. I have traversed a vast portion of the earth, and
have endured all the hardships which travellers, in deserts
and barbarous countries, are wont to meet. How I have

and kissed the earth, and with quivering lips exclaimed,
"By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that
wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel,
I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside
over thee, to pursue the d√¶mon, who caused this misery,
until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For
this purpose I will preserve my life: to execute this dear
