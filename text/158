my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the
d√¶mon's disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland,
and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. This idea pursued
me, and tormented me at every moment from which
I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I
waited for my letters with feverish impatience: if they were
delayed, I was miserable, and overcome by a thousand fears;
and when they arrived, and I saw the superscription of
Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain
my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me,
and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.
When these thoughts possessed me, I would not
quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow,
to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer.
I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness
of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I
had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as
mortal as that of crime.

I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and
yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate
being. Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford: for the
antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But
the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh,
its romantic castle, and its environs, the most delightful in
the world, Arthur's Seat, St. Bernard's Well, and the Pentland
Hills, compensated him for the change, and filled him
with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to
arrive at the termination of my journey.

We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar,
St. Andrew's, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth,
where our friend expected us. But I was in no mood to
laugh and talk with strangers, or enter into their feelings or
plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and
accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of
Scotland alone. "Do you," said I, "enjoy yourself, and
let this be our rendezvous. I may be absent a month or
two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you:
leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when
I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial
to your own temper."
