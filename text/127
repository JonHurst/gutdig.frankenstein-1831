had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved
every feeling of wonder and awe, that the picture of an
omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of
exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their
similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently
united by no link to any other being in existence;
but his state was far different from mine in every other
respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect
creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial
care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with, and
acquire knowledge from, beings of a superior nature: but I
was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many times I considered
Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition; for
often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors,
the bitter gall of envy rose within me.

“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these
feelings. Soon after my arrival in the hovel, I discovered
some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken
from your laboratory. At first I had neglected them; but
now that I was able to decipher the characters in which
they were written, I began to study them with diligence.
It was your journal of the four months that preceded my
creation. You minutely described in these papers every
step you took in the progress of your work; this history
was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences. You,
doubtless, recollect these papers. Here they are. Every
thing is related in them which bears reference to my accursed
origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting
circumstances which produced it, is set in view; the minutest
description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in
language which painted your own horrors, and rendered
mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful day when
I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator!
Why did you form a monster so hideous that even {{you}}
turned from me in disgust? God, in pity, made man
beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form
is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very
resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow-devils, to
admire and encourage him; but I am solitary and
abhorred.’
