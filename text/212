ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away
from his lips.

Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely
extinction of this glorious spirit? What can I say, that
will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?
All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble.
My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I
may there find consolation.

I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It
is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck
scarcely stir. Again; there is a sound as of a human voice,
but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of
Frankenstein still lie. I must arise, and examine. Good
night, my sister.

Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am
yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. I hardly know whether
I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I
have recorded would be incomplete without this final and
wonderful catastrophe.

I entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my ill-fated
and admirable friend. Over him hung a form which I
cannot find words to describe; gigantic in stature, yet uncouth
and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the
coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair;
but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent
texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound
of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief
and horror, and sprung towards the window. Never did I
behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome,
yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily,
and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with
regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay.

He paused, looking on me with wonder; and, again
turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed
to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed
instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.

“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed: “in his
murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series
of my being is wound to its close! Oh, Frankenstein!
