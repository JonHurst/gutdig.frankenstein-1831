for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen
eye, and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my
manner.

The son confirmed his fatherâ€™s account: but when Daniel
Nugent was called, he swore positively that, just before the
fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in
it, at a short distance from the shore; and, as far as he
could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat
in which I had just landed.

A woman deposed, that she lived near the beach, and
was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return
of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of

one man in it, push off from that part of the shore where
the corpse was afterwards found.

Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen
having brought the body into her house; it was not cold.
They put it into a bed, and rubbed it; and Daniel went to
the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.

Several other men were examined concerning my landing;
and they agreed, that, with the strong north wind
that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that
I had beaten about for many hours, and had been obliged

Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had
brought the body from another place, and it was likely,
that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might
have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the
town of * * * from the place where I had deposited
the corpse.

Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should
be taken into the room where the body lay for interment,

produce upon me. This idea was probably suggested by
the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of
the murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted,
by the magistrate and several other persons, to the
inn. I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences
that had taken place during this eventful night; but,
knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in
