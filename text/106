at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the
night before, to trust myself in his power. I had first,
however, provided for my sustenance for that day, by a loaf
of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which
I could drink, more conveniently than from my hand, of
the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was
a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its
vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.

“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel,
until something should occur which might alter my determination.
It was indeed a paradise, compared to the
bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping
branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure,
and was about to remove a plank to procure myself

busied, sometimes in the house, and sometimes in the yard.

“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the
windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it,
but the panes had been filled up with wood. In one of
these was a small and almost imperceptible chink, through
which the eye could just penetrate. Through this crevice
a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean, but very
bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an
old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate
