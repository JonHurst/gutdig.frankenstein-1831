abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had created. I
trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach,
and then close with him in mortal combat. He
approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined
with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But
I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived
me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm
him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.

"Devil," I exclaimed, "do you dare approach me? and

the existence of another.

He easily eluded me, and said--

"Be calm! I entreat you to hear me, before you give
vent to your hatred on my devoted head. Have I not suffered
enough, that you seek to increase my misery? Life,
