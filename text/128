"These were the reflections of my hours of despondency
and solitude; but when I contemplated the virtues of
the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I
persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted
with my admiration of their virtues, they would compassionate
me, and overlook my personal deformity. Could
they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who
solicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at
least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an
interview with them which would decide my fate. I postponed
this attempt for some months longer; for the importance
attached to its success inspired me with a dread
lest I should fail. Besides, I found that my understanding
improved so much with every day's experience, that I was
unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more
months should have added to my sagacity.

"Several changes, in the mean time, took place in the
cottage. The presence of Safie diffused happiness among
its inhabitants; and I also found that a greater degree of
plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent more time in
amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours
by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were
contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful,
while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase
of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly
what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is
true; but it vanished, when I beheld my person reflected
in water, or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail
image and that inconstant shade.

"I endeavoured to crush these fears, and to fortify myself
for the trial which in a few months I resolved to
undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked
by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to
fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my
feelings, and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances
breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a
dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows, nor shared my thoughts;
I was alone. I remembered Adam's supplication to his
Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,
and, in the bitterness of my heart, I cursed him.
