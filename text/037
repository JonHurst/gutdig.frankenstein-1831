The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed
eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly
communicated her history. She was not her child, but the
daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a
German, and had died on giving her birth. The infant

while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening
previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had
said playfully, – “I have a pretty present for my Victor – to-morrow
he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow,
she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with
childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally, and
looked upon Elizabeth as mine – mine to protect, love, and
