mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood."
My manner, as I thus addressed him, was impressive, but
calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue
my destroyer to death; and this purpose quieted my
agony, and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now
related my history, briefly, but with firmness and precision,
marking the dates with accuracy, and never deviating into
invective or exclamation.

The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous,
but as I continued he became more attentive and interested;
I saw him sometimes shudder with horror, at others
a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on
his countenance.

When I had concluded my narration, I said, "This is
the being whom I accuse, and for whose seizure and punishment
I call upon you to exert your whole power. It is
your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your
feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those
functions on this occasion."

This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy
of my own auditor. He had heard my story with
that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and
supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act
officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity
returned. He, however, answered mildly, "I would willingly
afford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature
of whom you speak appears to have powers which
would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow
an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit
caves and dens where no man would venture to
intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the
commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to
what place he has wandered, or what region he may now
inhabit."

"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which
I inhabit; and if he has indeed taken refuge in the
Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois, and destroyed as
a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts: you do not
credit my narrative, and do not intend to pursue my enemy
with the punishment which is his desert."
