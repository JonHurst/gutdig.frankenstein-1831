been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the
pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The
shutters had been thrown back; and, with a sensation of
horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a
figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the
face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish
finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed
towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom,
fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and, running

The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room.
I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we
followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain.
After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of

various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes,
and their cause. I was bewildered in a cloud of wonder
and horror. The death of William, the execution of Justine,
the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at
that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends
were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even
