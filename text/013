Dr. Darwin, (I speak not of what the Doctor really did, or
said that he did, but, as more to my purpose, of what was
then spoken of as having been done by him,) who preserved
a piece of vermicelli in a glass case, till by some
extraordinary means it began to move with voluntary
motion. Not thus, after all, would life be given. Perhaps
a corpse would be re-animated; galvanism had
given token of such things: perhaps the component
parts of a creature might be manufactured, brought together,
and endued with vital warmth.

Night waned upon this talk, and even the witching
hour had gone by, before we retired to rest. When I
placed my head on my pillow, I did not sleep, nor
could I be said to think. My imagination, unbidden,
possessed and guided me, gifting the successive images
that arose in my mind with a vividness far beyond the
usual bounds of reverie. I saw – with shut eyes, but
acute mental vision, – I saw the pale student of unhallowed
arts kneeling beside the thing he had put
together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched
out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine,
show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital
motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful
would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock
the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world.
His success would terrify the artist; he would rush
away from his odious handywork, horror-stricken. He
would hope that, left to itself, the slight spark of life
which he had communicated would fade; that this
thing, which had received such imperfect animation,
would subside into dead matter; and he might sleep in
the belief that the silence of the grave would quench
for ever the transient existence of the hideous corpse
