I should not be altogether free from blame. A human
being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and
peaceful mind, and never to allow passion or a transitory
desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the
pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the
study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken
your affections, and to destroy your taste for those simple
pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that
study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the
human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no
man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the
tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been
enslaved; Cæsar would have spared his country; America
would have been discovered more gradually; and the empires
of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.

But I forget that I am moralising in the most interesting
part of my tale; and your looks remind me to proceed.

My father made no reproach in his letters, and only took
notice of my silence by enquiring into my occupations
more particularly than before. Winter, spring, and summer
passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the
blossom or the expanding leaves – sights which before
always yielded me supreme delight – so deeply was I engrossed
in my occupation. The leaves of that year had
withered before my work drew near to a close; and now
every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded.
But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety,
and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in
the mines, or any other unwholesome trade, than an artist
occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was
oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most
painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned
my fellow-creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime.
Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I
had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me:
my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and
amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I
promised myself both of these when my creation should be
complete.
