walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours,
when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing
in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the
post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three
weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can
easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and
to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among
those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not
intend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I
return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?
If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass
before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me
again soon, or never.

Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower
down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and
again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.

 Your affectionate brother,

 R. Walton.

{{To Mrs. Saville, England.}}

Archangel, 28th March, 17--.

How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am
by frost and snow! yet a second step is taken towards my
enterprise. I have hired a vessel, and am occupied in collecting
my sailors; those whom I have already engaged,
appear to be men on whom I can depend, and are certainly
possessed of dauntless courage.

But I have one want which I have never yet been able

when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there
will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by
disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in
dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is
true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of
