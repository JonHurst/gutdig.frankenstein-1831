{{To Mrs. Saville, England.}}

August 5th, 17--.

So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot
forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you

the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape
of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the
sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress

ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to
