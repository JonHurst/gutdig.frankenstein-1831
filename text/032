 August 19. 17--.

Yesterday the stranger said to me, "You may easily
perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and
unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined, at one time,
that the memory of these evils should die with me; but
you have won me to alter my determination. You seek
for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently
hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a
serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know
that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet,
when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing
yourself to the same dangers which have rendered
me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral
from my tale; one that may direct you if you succeed in
your undertaking, and console you in case of failure. Prepare
to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous.
Were we among the tamer scenes of nature, I
might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule;
but many things will appear possible in these wild and
mysterious regions, which would provoke the laughter of
those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature:--nor
can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series
internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is
composed."

You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the
offered communication; yet I could not endure that he
should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I
felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative,
partly from curiosity, and partly from a strong desire to
ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed
these feelings in my answer.

"I thank you," he replied, "for your sympathy, but
it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for
one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand
your feeling," continued he, perceiving that I wished to
interrupt him; "but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus
you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny:
listen to my history, and you will perceive how
irrevocably it is determined."
