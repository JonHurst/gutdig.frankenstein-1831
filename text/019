example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly
are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be
expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover
the wondrous power which attracts the needle; and
may regulate a thousand celestial observations, that require
only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent
for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with
the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and
may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of
man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient
to conquer all fear of danger or death, and to induce me
to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child
feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates,
on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But,
supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest
the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all
mankind to the last generation, by discovering a passage
near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present
so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret
of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected
by an undertaking such as mine.

These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which
I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm
which elevates me to heaven; for nothing contributes
so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose, – a
point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.
This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early
years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various
voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving
at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround
the pole. You may remember, that a history of all the
voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole
of our good uncle Thomas’s library. My education was
neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These
volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity
with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child,
on learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden
my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.

These visions faded when I perused, for the first time,
those poets whose effusions entranced my soul, and lifted
