iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling
and hopeless, into my miserable self.

We left Oxford with regret, and proceeded to Matlock,
which was our next place of rest. The country in the
neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree,
the scenery of Switzerland; but every thing is on a lower
scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white
Alps, which always attend on the piny mountains of my native
country. We visited the wondrous cave, and the little
cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed
in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.
The latter name made me tremble, when pronounced
by Henry; and I hastened to quit Matlock, with
which that terrible scene was thus associated.

From Derby, still journeying northward, we passed two
months in Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now
almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The
little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern
sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the
rocky streams, were all familiar and dear sights to me.
Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived
to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval
was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded
in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own
nature greater capacities and resources than he could have
imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with
his inferiors. "I could pass my life here," said he to me;
"and among these mountains I should scarcely regret
Switzerland and the Rhine."

But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes
much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for
ever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose,
he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in
pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention,
and which also he forsakes for other novelties.

We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland
and Westmorland, and conceived an affection for some of
the inhabitants, when the period of our appointment with
our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on.
For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected
