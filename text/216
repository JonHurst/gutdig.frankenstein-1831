the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when
that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.

“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief.
My work is nearly complete. Neither yours nor
any man’s death is needed to consummate the series of my
being, and accomplish that which must be done; but it
requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to
perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice-raft
which brought me thither, and shall seek the most
northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral
pile, and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its
remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed
wretch, who would create such another as I have been. I
shall die. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume
me, or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched. He
is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no
more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish.
I shall no longer see the sun or stars, or feel the winds play
on my cheeks. Light, feeling, and sense will pass away;
and in this condition must I find my happiness. Some
years ago, when the images which this world affords first
opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer,
and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling
of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept
to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes,
and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but
in death?

“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of human
kind whom these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein!
If thou wert yet alive, and yet cherished a desire
of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my
life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou
didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater
wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me,
thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not
desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I
feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to
thine; for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle
in my wounds until death shall close them for ever.
