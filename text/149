commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be
restored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise
fulfilled, the monster would depart for ever. Or (so
my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile
occur to destroy him, and put an end to my slavery for ever.

These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed
a wish to visit England; but, concealing the true
reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under a guise
which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an
earnestness that easily induced my father to comply. After

prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable
slavery, I might claim Elizabeth, and forget the past in
my union with her.

I now made arrangements for my journey; but one
