Henry wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on
this plan, ceased to remonstrate. He entreated me to write
often. “I had rather be with you,” he said, “in your
solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do
not know: hasten then, my dear friend, to return, that I
may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot
do in your absence.”

Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit
some remote spot of Scotland, and finish my work in solitude.
I did not doubt but that the monster followed me,
and would discover himself to me when I should have
finished, that he might receive his companion.

With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands,
and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene
of my labours. It was a place fitted for such a work, being
hardly more than a rock, whose high sides were continually
beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely
affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for
its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt

had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was
off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some
furniture, and took possession; an incident which would,
doubtless, have occasioned some surprise, had not all the
senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid
poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested,
hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which
I gave; so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest
sensations of men.

In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in
the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the
stony beach of the sea, to listen to the waves as they roared
and dashed at my feet. It was a monotonous yet
