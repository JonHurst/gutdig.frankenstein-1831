for my own consumption; but when I found that in doing
this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained, and satisfied
myself with berries, nuts, and roots, which I gathered
from a neighbouring wood.

“I discovered also another means through which I was
enabled to assist their labours. I found that the youth
spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the
family fire; and, during the night, I often took his tools,
the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home
firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.

“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young
woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared
greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the
outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the
youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed,
with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but
spent it in repairing the cottage, and cultivating the garden.

“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment.
I found that these people possessed a method of communicating
their experience and feelings to one another by
articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke
sometimes, produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in
the minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed
a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become
acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every attempt I
made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick;
and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection
with visible objects, I was unable to discover any
clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference.
By great application, however, and after having remained
during the space of several revolutions of the moon
in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to
some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned
and applied the words, {{fire}}, {{milk}}, {{bread}}, and {{wood}}. I
learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The
youth and his companion had each of them several names,
but the old man had only one, which was {{father}}. The
girl was called {{sister}}, or {{Agatha}}; and the youth {{Felix}}, {{brother}},
or {{son}}. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I
learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds, and
