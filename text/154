CHAPTER XIX.

London was our present point of rest; we determined to
remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated
city. Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius
and talent who flourished at this time; but this was with
me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the
means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion

sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this as
much as possible, that I might not debar him from the
