insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat, and
resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was
preparing for myself a deadly torture; but I was the slave,
not the master, of an impulse, which I detested, yet could
not disobey. Yet when she died! – nay, then I was not
miserable. I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish,
to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became
my good. Urged thus far, I had no choice but to
adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly
chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became
an insatiable passion. And now it is ended; there is my
last victim!”

I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery;
yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of
his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again
cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation
was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said, “it is well

the feelings of happiness and affection with which my
whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated.
But now, that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that
happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing
despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content
to suffer alone, while my sufferings shall endure: when I
die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium
should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed
with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once
I falsely hoped to meet with beings, who, pardoning my
