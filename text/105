warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white
ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and,
depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in a
wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several
hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous
did this appear! the huts, the neater cottages, and
stately houses, engaged my admiration by turns. The
vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw
placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my
appetite. One of the best of these I entered; but I had
hardly placed my foot within the door, before the children
shrieked, and one of the women fainted. The whole village
was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,
grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile
weapons, I escaped to the open country, and fearfully

of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man.

"As soon as morning dawned, I crept from my kennel,
that I might view the adjacent cottage, and discover if I

situated against the back of the cottage, and surrounded on
the sides which were exposed by a pig-sty and a clear pool
of water. One part was open, and by that I had crept in;
but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived
with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I
might move them on occasion to pass out: all the light I
enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me.
