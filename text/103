with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained
in the forest. My sensations had, by this time, become
distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas.
My eyes became accustomed to the light, and to perceive
objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect
from the herb, and, by degrees, one herb from another. I
found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst
those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.

“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire
which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was
overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from
it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but
quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,
I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite
effects! I examined the materials of the fire, and
to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I quickly
collected some branches; but they were wet, and would not

operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed
near the heat dried, and itself became inflamed. I reflected

my cloak, I lay on the ground, and sunk into sleep.

“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was

quickly fanned it into a flame. I observed this also, and
contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when
they were nearly extinguished. When night came again,
I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as
heat; and that the discovery of this element was useful to
me in my food; for I found some of the offals that the
travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more
savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I
tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner,
placing it on the live embers. I found that the berries
