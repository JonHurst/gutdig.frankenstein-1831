which he had looked upon as the cradle of life. He
sleeps; but he is awakened; he opens his eyes; behold
the horrid thing stands at his bedside, opening his curtains,
and looking on him with yellow, watery, but
speculative eyes.

I opened mine in terror. The idea so possessed my
mind, that a thrill of fear ran through me, and I wished
to exchange the ghastly image of my fancy for the
realities around. I see them still; the very room, the
dark {{parquet}}, the closed shutters, with the moonlight
struggling through, and the sense I had that the glassy
lake and white high Alps were beyond. I could not so
easily get rid of my hideous phantom; still it haunted
me. I must try to think of something else. I recurred
to my ghost story, – my tiresome unlucky ghost story!
O! if I could only contrive one which would frighten
my reader as I myself had been frightened that night!

Swift as light and as cheering was the idea that broke
in upon me. “I have found it! What terrified me will
terrify others; and I need only describe the spectre
which had haunted my midnight pillow.” On the morrow
I announced that I had {{thought of a story}}. I began
that day with the words, {{It was on a dreary night of November}},
making only a transcript of the grim terrors of
my waking dream.

At first I thought but of a few pages – of a short tale;
but Shelley urged me to develope the idea at greater
length. I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one
incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling, to my husband,
and yet but for his incitement, it would never have
taken the form in which it was presented to the world.
From this declaration I must except the preface. As
far as I can recollect, it was entirely written by him.
