All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy
clouded every thought. The rain was pouring in torrents,
and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that
I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends. Still I
would penetrate their misty veil, and seek them in their
cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My
mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to
the summit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that
the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had
produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then
filled me with a sublime ecstasy, that gave wings to the
soul, and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light
and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had
indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind, and
causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined
to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted
with the path, and the presence of another would destroy
the solitary grandeur of the scene.

The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual

the perpendicularity of the mountain. It is a scene terrifically
desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the
winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken
and strewed on the ground; some entirely destroyed,
others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain,
or transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend
higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which
stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly
dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even
speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient
to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker.
The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre,
and add an air of severity to the scene. I looked on the
valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers
which ran through it, and curling in thick wreaths around
the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the
uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky, and
added to the melancholy impression I received from the
objects around me. Alas! why does man boast of sensibilities
superior to those apparent in the brute; it only
