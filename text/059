Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her; but
as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid
with the hue of death; her features appeared to change,
and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in
my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the
grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started
from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead,

horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that
had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space
were now become a hell to me; and the change was so
rapid, the overthrow so complete!
