remembrance of the threat returned: nor can you wonder,
that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of
blood, I should almost regard him as invincible; and that
when he had pronounced the words, “I shall be with you
on your wedding-night,” I should regard the threatened
fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me, if the
loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it; and I therefore,
with a contented and even cheerful countenance,
agreed with my father, that if my cousin would consent,
the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put,
as I imagined, the seal to my fate.

Great God! if for one instant I had thought what might

deep and everlasting regret.

Preparations were made for the event; congratulatory
visits were received; and all wore a smiling appearance. I
shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety
that preyed there, and entered with seeming earnestness into
the plans of my father, although they might only serve as
the decorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions,
a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been
restored to her by the Austrian government. A small
possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It was
agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed
