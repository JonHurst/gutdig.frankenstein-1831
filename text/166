Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on
which I shuddered to reflect: I must pack up my chemical
instruments; and for that purpose I must enter the room
which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must
handle those utensils, the sight of which was sickening to
me. The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient
courage, and unlocked the door of my laboratory.
The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had
destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if
I had mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused
to collect myself, and then entered the chamber. With

did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard
weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary
act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my
own mind, that to create another like the fiend I had first
made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious
selfishness; and I banished from my mind every thought
that could lead to a different conclusion.

Between two and three in the morning the moon rose;
and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed
out about four miles from the shore. The scene was perfectly
solitary: a few boats were returning towards land,
but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the
commission of a dreadful crime, and avoided with shuddering
anxiety any encounter with my fellow-creatures. At
