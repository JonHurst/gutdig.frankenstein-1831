One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce
Clerval to the several professors of the university. In doing
this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the
wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal
night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my
misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to
the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise
quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument
would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry
saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view.
He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived
that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously
been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval
were made of no avail when I visited the professors.
M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness
and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in
the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject;
but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my
feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement,
to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently
saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant to
please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed
carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which
were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and
cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not
exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings
were always quick in discerning the sensations of others,
declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance;
and the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked
my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw
plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to
draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with
a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds,
yet I could never persuade myself to confide to him that
event which was so often present to my recollection, but
which I feared the detail to another would only impress
more deeply.

M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition
at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh
blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the
