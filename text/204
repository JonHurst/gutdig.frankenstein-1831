His tale is connected, and told with an appearance of the
simplest truth; yet I own to you that the letters of Felix
and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the
monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction
of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,
however earnest and connected. Such a monster has then
really existence! I cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise
and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain
from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature's formation:
but on this point he was impenetrable.

"Are you mad, my friend?" said he; "or whither
does your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also
create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy?
Peace, peace! learn my miseries, and do not seek to increase
your own."

Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning
his history: he asked to see them, and then himself corrected
and augmented them in many places; but principally
in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he
held with his enemy. "Since you have preserved my narration,"
said he, "I would not that a mutilated one should
go down to posterity."

Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to
the strangest tale that ever imagination formed. My
thoughts, and every feeling of my soul, have been drunk up
by the interest for my guest, which this tale, and his own
elevated and gentle manners, have created. I wish to soothe
him; yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute
of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! the
only joy that he can now know will be when he composes
his shattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one
comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium: he believes,
that, when in dreams he holds converse with his friends,
and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries,
or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the
creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit
him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives
a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as
imposing and interesting as truth.

Our conversations are not always confined to his own
