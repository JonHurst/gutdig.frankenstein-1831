And now, once again, I bid my hideous progeny go
forth and prosper. I have an affection for it, for it was
the offspring of happy days, when death and grief were
but words, which found no true echo in my heart. Its
several pages speak of many a walk, many a drive, and
many a conversation, when I was not alone; and my companion
was one who, in this world, I shall never see
more. But this is for myself; my readers have nothing
to do with these associations.

I will add but one word as to the alterations I have
made. They are principally those of style. I have
changed no portion of the story, nor introduced any
new ideas or circumstances. I have mended the language
where it was so bald as to interfere with the
interest of the narrative; and these changes occur
almost exclusively in the beginning of the first volume.
Throughout they are entirely confined to such parts as
are mere adjuncts to the story, leaving the core and
substance of it untouched.
