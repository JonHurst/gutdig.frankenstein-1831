mingled with these, as the work proceeded. I am by no
means indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral
tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it contains
shall affect the reader; yet my chief concern in this respect
has been limited to the avoiding the enervating effects of
the novels of the present day, and to the exhibition of the
amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence of
universal virtue. The opinions which naturally spring
from the character and situation of the hero are by no
means to be conceived as existing always in my own conviction;
nor is any inference justly to be drawn from the
following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of
whatever kind.

It is a subject also of additional interest to the author,
that this story was begun in the majestic region where the
scene is principally laid, and in society which cannot cease
to be regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in the environs
of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy, and in
the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire, and
occasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of
ghosts, which happened to fall into our hands. These tales
excited in us a playful desire of imitation. Two other
friends (a tale from the pen of one of whom would be far
more acceptable to the public than any thing I can ever
hope to produce) and myself agreed to write each a story,
founded on some supernatural occurrence.

The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my
two friends left me on a journey among the Alps, and lost,
in the magnificent scenes which they present, all memory
of their ghostly visions. The following tale is the only one
which has been completed.

Marlow, September, 1817.
