ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was far
different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its
hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered
thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle
sky; and, when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but
as the play of a lively infant, when compared to the roarings
of the giant ocean.

In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first
arrived; but, as I proceeded in my labour, it became every
day more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could
not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several
days; and at other times I toiled day and night in order
to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in
which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind
of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my
employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation
of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror
of my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood,
and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.

Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation,
immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an
instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I
was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless
and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor.
Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground,
fearing to raise them, lest they should encounter the object
which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander
from the sight of my fellow-creatures, lest when alone he
should come to claim his companion.

In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was
already considerably advanced. I looked towards its completion
with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not
trust myself to question, but which was intermixed with
obscure forebodings of evil, that made my heart sicken in my
bosom.
