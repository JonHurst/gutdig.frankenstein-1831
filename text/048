I returned home, not disappointed, for I have said that
I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor
reprobated; but I returned, not at all the more inclined
to recur to these studies in any shape. M. Krempe
was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and a repulsive
countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me
in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical
and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account
of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my
early years. As a child, I had not been content with the
results promised by the modern professors of natural science.
With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my
extreme youth, and my want of a guide on such matters,
I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time,
and exchanged the discoveries of recent enquirers for the
dreams of forgotten alchymists. Besides, I had a contempt
for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very
different, when the masters of the science sought immortality
and power; such views, although futile, were grand:
but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the
enquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those
visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded.
I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur
for realities of little worth.

Such were my reflections during the first two or three
days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly
spent in becoming acquainted with the localities, and the
principal residents in my new abode. But as the ensuing
week commenced, I thought of the information which
M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And
although I could not consent to go and hear that little
conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected
what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never
seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.

Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went
into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly
after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He
appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive
of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered
his temples, but those at the back of his head were
