CHAPTER XX.

I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and
the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient
light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause
of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for
the night, or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention
to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to
me, which led me to consider the effects of what I was now
doing. Three years before I was engaged in the same

a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for
my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?
I had before been moved by the sophisms of
the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his
