recalled me to action. I started up, and resolved to return
to Geneva with all possible speed.

There were no horses to be procured, and I must return
by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain
fell in torrents. However, it was hardly morning, and I
might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to
row, and took an oar myself; for I had always experienced
relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the
overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation
that I endured, rendered me incapable of any exertion. I
threw down the oar; and leaning my head upon my hands,
gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up,
I saw the scenes which were familiar to me in my happier
time, and which I had contemplated but the day before in
the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.
Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had
ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters
as they had done a few hours before; they had then been
observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human
mind as a great and sudden change. The sun might shine,
or the clouds might lower: but nothing could appear to me
as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched from
me every hope of future happiness: no creature had ever
been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single
in the history of man.

But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed
this last overwhelming event? Mine has been a
tale of horrors; I have reached their {{acme}}, and what I
must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that,
one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left
desolate. My own strength is exhausted; and I must tell,
in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration.

I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived;
but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore. I see
him now, excellent and venerable old man! his eyes wandered
in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their
delight â€“ his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he
doated on with all that affection which a man feels, who in
the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly
to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend
