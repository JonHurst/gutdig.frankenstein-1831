dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.

“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the
miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the
world and its works as they before appeared to me. Before,
I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice, that I
read in books or heard from others, as tales of ancient days,
or imaginary evils; at least they were remote, and more

escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected.
But even if I were condemned to suffer on the
scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with
such a wretch.”

not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth
read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking
my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you must calm yourself.
These events have affected me, God knows how
deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is
an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your
countenance, that makes me tremble. Dear Victor, banish
these dark passions. Remember the friends around you,
