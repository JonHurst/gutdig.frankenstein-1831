generous offer. You raise me from the dust by this kindness;
and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from
the society and sympathy of your fellow-creatures.’

“‘Heaven forbid! even if you were really criminal;
for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate
you to virtue. I also am unfortunate; I and my
family have been condemned, although innocent: judge,
therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’

“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?
From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness
directed towards me; I shall be for ever grateful; and your
present humanity assures me of success with those friends
whom I am on the point of meeting.’

“‘May I know the names and residence of those
friends?’

“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision,
which was to rob me of, or bestow happiness on me
for ever. I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to
answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining
strength; I sank on the chair, and sobbed aloud. At that
moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had
not a moment to lose; but, seizing the hand of the old
man, I cried, ‘Now is the time! – save and protect me!
You and your family are the friends whom I seek. Do
not you desert me in the hour of trial!’

“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man, ‘who are
you?’

“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix,
Safie, and Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror
and consternation on beholding me? Agatha fainted; and
Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the
cottage. Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force
tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung: in a
transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground, and struck
me violently with a stick. I could have torn him limb
from limb, as the lion rends the antelope. But my heart
sunk within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained.
I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome
by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the
general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”
