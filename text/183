solitude, from the society of every creature, I could not
help supposing that you might regret our connection, and
believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of
you parents, although they opposed themselves to your
inclinations. But this is false reasoning. I confess to you,
my friend, that I love you, and that in my airy dreams of
futurity you have been my constant friend and companion.
But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own, when
I declare to you, that our marriage would render me eternally
miserable, unless it were the dictate of your own free choice.
Even now I weep to think, that, borne down as you are by
the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word {{honour}},

be made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my
friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain
satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt
my tranquillity.

 "Geneva, May 18th, 17--."

This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten,
the threat of the fiend--"{{I will be with you on your
wedding night!}}" Such was my sentence, and on that night
would the d√¶mon employ every art to destroy me, and tear
me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to
console my sufferings. On that night he had determined to
consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a
deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if
he were victorious I should be at peace, and his power over
me be at an end. If he were vanquished, I should be a
free man. Alas! what freedom? such as the peasant enjoys
