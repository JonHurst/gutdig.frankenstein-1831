whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant and adventurous
benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of
Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful
home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft
voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there
to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of love
to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my
study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she
was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.
And Clerval – could aught ill entrench on the noble
spirit of Clerval? – yet he might not have been so perfectly
humane, so thoughtful in his generosity – so full of
kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous
exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of
beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim of
his soaring ambition.

I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections
of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind, and
changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into
gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, in
drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those
events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of
misery: for when I would account to myself for the birth
of that passion, which afterwards ruled my destiny, I find
it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost
forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became
the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all
my hopes and joys.

Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my
fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to state those
facts which led to my predilection for that science. When
I was thirteen years of age, we all went on a party of
pleasure to the baths near Thonon: the inclemency of the
weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn.
In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of
Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory
which he attempts to demonstrate, and the wonderful facts
which he relates, soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.
A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind; and, bounding
with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father.
