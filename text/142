not call it murder, if you could precipitate me into one
of those ice-rifts, and destroy my frame, the work of your
own hands. Shall I respect man, when he contemns me?
Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness; and,
instead of injury, I would bestow every benefit upon him
with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot
be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our
union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject
slavery. I will revenge my injuries: if I cannot inspire
love, I will cause fear; and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy,
because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable

A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face
was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes
to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded--

“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to
me; for you do not reflect that {{you}} are the cause of its
excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards

the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that
cannot be realised. What I ask of you is reasonable and
moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as
hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all
that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we
shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that
account we shall be more attached to one another. Our
lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless, and free
from the misery I now feel. Oh! my creator, make me
happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit!
Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing
thing; do not deny me my request!”

I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible
consequences of my consent; but I felt that there was
some justice in his argument. His tale, and the feelings
he now expressed, proved him to be a creature of fine sensations;
and did I not as his maker, owe him all the portion
