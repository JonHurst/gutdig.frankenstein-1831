experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch
of natural philosophy, including mathematics."

He then took me into his laboratory, and explained to
me the uses of his various machines; instructing me as to
what I ought to procure, and promising me the use of his
own when I should have advanced far enough in the science
not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the
list of books which I had requested; and I took my
leave.

Thus ended a day memorable to me: it decided my
future destiny.

CHAPTER IV.

From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry,
in the most comprehensive sense of the term,
became nearly my sole occupation. I read with ardour
those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which
modern enquirers have written on these subjects. I attended
the lectures, and cultivated the acquaintance, of
the men of science of the university; and I found even in
M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information,
combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy
and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In
M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was
never tinged by dogmatism; and his instructions were
given with an air of frankness and good nature, that

My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it
gained strength as I proceeded, and soon became so ardent
and eager, that the stars often disappeared in the light of
morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.

As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that
my progress was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment
of the students, and my proficiency that of the
