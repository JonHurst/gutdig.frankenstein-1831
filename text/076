itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the
case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of
the heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly north
of the town, over that part of the lake which lies between
the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another
storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another
darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked
mountain to the east of the lake.

While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I
wandered on with a hasty step. This noble war in the
sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed
aloud, "William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy
dirge!" As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom

of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the
south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.

I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the
rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an
impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the events
which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train
of my progress towards the creation; the appearance of the
work of my own hands alive at my bedside; its departure.
Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which
