fiendish threats: but now, for the first time, the wickedness
of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that
future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness
had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps,
of the existence of the whole human race.

I trembled, and my heart failed within me; when, on
looking up, I saw, by the light of the moon, the d√¶mon at

silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme
profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the
paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close
to my house.

In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door,
as if some one endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled
from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was, and
