approached the shore--often, I say, I was tempted to plunge
into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me
and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained, when I
thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly
loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.
I thought also of my father, and surviving brother: should
I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected
to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose
among them?

At these moments I wept bitterly, and wished that peace
would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation
and happiness. But that could not be. Remorse

wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost
extent of abhorrence on his head, and avenge the deaths of
William and Justine.

Our house was the house of mourning. My fatherâ€™s
health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent
events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer
took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed
to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears
she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence
so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer that
happy creature, who in earlier youth wandered with me
on the banks of the lake, and talked with ecstasy of our
future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are
