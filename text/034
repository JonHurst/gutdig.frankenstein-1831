honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the
town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness.
My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship,
and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate
circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which
led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection
that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek
him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the

month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan
and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and she knelt
by Beaufort’s coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered
the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the
