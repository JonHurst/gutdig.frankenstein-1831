I took the hand of Elizabeth: “You are sorrowful,
my love. Ah! if you knew what I have suffered, and
what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me
taste the quiet and freedom from despair, that this one day
at least permits me to enjoy.”

“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there
is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if
a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented.
Something whispers to me not to depend too much
on the prospect that is opened before us; but I will not
listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move
along, and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and
sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this
scene of beauty still more interesting. Look also at the
innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters,
where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom.
What a divine day! how happy and serene all nature
appears!”

Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and
mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her
temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in
her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and
reverie.

The sun sunk lower in the heavens; we passed the river
Drance, and observed its path through the chasms of the
higher, and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here
come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre
of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.
The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded
it, and the range of mountain above mountain by which it
was overhung.

The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with
amazing rapidity, sunk at sunset to a light breeze; the soft
air just ruffled the water, and caused a pleasant motion
among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it
wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The
sun sunk beneath the horizon as we landed; and as I
touched the shore, I felt those cares and fears revive, which
soon were to clasp me, and cling to me for ever.
