great and overwhelming, that all the steps by which I had
been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld
only the result. What had been the study and desire of
the wisest men since the creation of the world was now
within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it all
opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained
was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as
I should point them towards the object of my search, than
to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the
Arabian who had been buried with the dead, and found a
passage to life, aided only by one glimmering, and seemingly
ineffectual, light.

I see by your eagerness, and the wonder and hope which
your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed
of the secret with which I am acquainted; that
cannot be: listen patiently until the end of my story, and
you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject.
I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I

When I found so astonishing a power placed within my
hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in
which I should employ it. Although I possessed the capacity
of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for
the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles,
and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty
and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt
the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization;
but my imagination was too much exalted by my
first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life
to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The
materials at present within my command hardly appeared
adequate to so arduous an undertaking; but I doubted not
that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a
multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly
baffled, and at last my work be imperfect: yet, when I
