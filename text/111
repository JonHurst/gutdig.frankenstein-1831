was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other
words, without being able as yet to understand or apply
them; such as {{good}}, {{dearest}}, {{unhappy}}.

"I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners
and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to
me: when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when
they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw few human
beings beside them; and if any other happened to
enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only
enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends.
The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage
his children, as sometimes I found that he called
them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a
cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed
pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with
respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she
endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally
found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful
after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It
was not thus with Felix. He was always the saddest of
the group; and, even to my unpractised senses, he appeared
to have suffered more deeply than his friends. But
if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more
cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed
the old man.

"I could mention innumerable instances, which, although
slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable
cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried
with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that
peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the
morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that
obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the
well, and brought the wood from the out-house, where, to
his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished
by an invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he
worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he
often went forth, and did not return until dinner, yet
brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in
the garden; but, as there was little to do in the frosty season,
he read to the old man and Agatha.
