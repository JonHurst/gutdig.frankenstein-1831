seemed to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly
recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed
to attest her utter guiltlessness.

The trial began; and, after the advocate against her had
stated the charge, several witnesses were called. Several
strange facts combined against her, which might have
staggered any one who had not such proof of her innocence
as I had. She had been out the whole of the night
