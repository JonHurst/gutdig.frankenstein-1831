station among other human beings. Now my desires were
complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to
repent.

I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections
during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long
and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the
town met my eyes. I alighted, and was conducted to my
solitary apartment, to spend the evening as I pleased.

The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction,
and paid a visit to some of the principal professors. Chance--or
rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction,
which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment
I turned my reluctant steps from my father's door--led
me first to Mr. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.
He was an uncouth man, but deeply embued in the secrets
of his science. He asked me several questions concerning
my progress in the different branches of science appertaining
to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly; and, partly
in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchymists as the
principal authors I had studied. The professor stared:
"Have you," he said, "really spent your time in studying
such nonsense?"

I replied in the affirmative. "Every minute," continued
M. Krempe with warmth, "every instant that you have
wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You
have burdened your memory with exploded systems and
useless names. Good God! in what desert land have you
lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that
these fancies, which you have so greedily imbibed, are a
thousand years old, and as musty as they are ancient? I
little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find
a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear
sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew."

So saying, he stept aside, and wrote down a list of several
books treating of natural philosophy, which he desired me
to procure; and dismissed me, after mentioning that in the
beginning of the following week he intended to commence
a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general
relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow-professor, would
lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.
