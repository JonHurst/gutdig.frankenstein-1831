most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity, it softened
and attracted me. For a few moments I gazed with delight
on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely
lips; but presently my rage returned: I remembered that
I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful
creatures could bestow; and that she whose resemblance I
contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that
air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and
affright.

"Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me
with rage? I only wonder that at that moment, instead of
venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not
rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy them.

"While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot
where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded
hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared
to me to be empty. A woman was sleeping on some straw;
she was young: not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait
I held; but of an agreeable aspect, and blooming in
the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one
of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but
me. And then I bent over her, and whispered 'Awake,
fairest, thy lover is near--he who would give his life but to
obtain one look of affection from thine eyes: my beloved,
awake!'

"The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.
Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and
denounce the murderer? Thus would she assuredly act, if
her darkened eyes opened, and she beheld me. The thought
was madness; it stirred the fiend within me--not I, but
she shall suffer: the murder I have committed because I
am for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall
atone. The crime had its source in her: be hers the
punishment! Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary
laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief.
I bent over her, and placed the portrait securely in one of
the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.

"For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes
had taken place; sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes
resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever.
