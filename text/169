I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an
answer from a stranger; and I was also disconcerted on
perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his
companions. “Why do you answer me so roughly?” I
replied; “surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to
receive strangers so inhospitably.”

“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of
the English may be; but is the custom of the Irish to hate
villains.”

While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the
crowd rapidly increase. Their faces expressed a mixture
of curiosity and anger, which annoyed, and in some degree
alarmed me. I enquired the way to the inn; but no one
replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound
arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me;
when an ill-looking man approaching, tapped me on the
shoulder, and said, “Come, Sir, you must follow me to
Mr. Kirwin’s, to give an account of yourself.”

“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account
of myself? Is not this a free country?”

“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is
a magistrate; and you are to give an account of the death
of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.”

This answer startled me; but I presently recovered
myself. I was innocent; that could easily be proved:
accordingly I followed my conductor in silence, and was
led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to
sink from fatigue and hunger; but, being surrounded by a
crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that
no physical debility might be construed into apprehension
or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity
that was in a few moments to overwhelm me, and extinguish
in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.

I must pause here; for it requires all my fortitude to
recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about
to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection.
