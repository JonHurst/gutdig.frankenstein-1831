of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw
my change of feeling, and continued--

"If you consent, neither you nor any other human being
shall ever see us again: I will go to the vast wilds of South
America. My food is not that of man; I do not destroy
the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and
berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion
will be of the same nature as myself, and will be content
with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried

maker."

His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated
him, and sometimes felt a wish to console him;
but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass
that moved and talked, my heart sickened, and my feelings
were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to
