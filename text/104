were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much
improved.

"Food, however, became scarce; and I often spent the
whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the
pangs of hunger. When I found this, I resolved to quit
the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one
where the few wants I experienced would be more easily
satisfied. In this emigration, I exceedingly lamented the
loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident, and
knew not how to reproduce it. I gave several hours to
the serious consideration of this difficulty; but I was
obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it; and, wrapping
myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood
towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these
rambles, and at length discovered the open country. A

His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen,
and his flight, somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted

appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the
lake of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's
breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and
wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by
fatigue, I lay down among some straw, and fell asleep.

"It was noon when I awoke; and, allured by the
