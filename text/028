Two days passed in this manner before he was able to
speak; and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived
him of understanding. When he had in some measure
recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and attended
on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw
a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an
expression of wildness, and even madness; but there are
moments when, if any one performs an act of kindness
towards him, or does him any the most trifling service, his
whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam
of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.
But he is generally melancholy and despairing; and sometimes
he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of
woes that oppresses him.

When my guest was a little recovered, I had great
trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a
thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented
by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind
whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so
far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle?

His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the
deepest gloom; and he replied, "To seek one who fled
from me."

"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same
fashion?"

"Yes."

"Then I fancy we have seen him; for the day before
we picked you up, we saw some dogs drawing a sledge,
with a man in it, across the ice."

This aroused the stranger's attention; and he asked a
multitude of questions concerning the route which the d√¶mon,
as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he
was alone with me, he said,--"I have, doubtless, excited
your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but
you are too considerate to make enquiries."

"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and
inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of
mine."
