“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous
situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.”

Soon after this he enquired if I thought that the breaking
up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge? I replied, that
I could not answer with any degree of certainty; for the
ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller
might have arrived at a place of safety before that time;
but of this I could not judge.

From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying
frame of the stranger. He manifested the greatest
eagerness to be upon deck, to watch for the sledge which
had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain
in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness
of the atmosphere. I have promised that some one should
watch for him, and give him instant notice if any new object
should appear in sight.

Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence
up to the present day. The stranger has gradually

when any one except myself enters his cabin. Yet his
manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are
all interested in him, although they have had very little
communication with him. For my own part, I begin to
love him as a brother; and his constant and deep grief fills
me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been
a noble creature in his better days, being even now in
wreck so attractive and amiable.

I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I
should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found
a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery,
I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother
of my heart.

I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at
intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record.

My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites
at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing
degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by
misery, without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so
