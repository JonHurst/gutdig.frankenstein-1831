but it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my
desire of finding a friend--of my thirst for a more intimate
sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my
lot; and expressed my conviction that a man could boast
of little happiness, who did not enjoy this blessing.

“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are
unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better,
dearer than ourselves--such a friend ought to be--do not
lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.
I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures,
and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship.
You have hope, and the world before you, and have no
cause for despair. But I--I have lost every thing, and
cannot begin life anew.”

As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a
calm settled grief, that touched me to the heart. But he
was silent, and presently retired to his cabin.

Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more
deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry
sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful
regions, seems still to have the power of elevating his soul
from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may
suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments;
yet, when he has retired into himself, he will be like a
celestial spirit, that has a halo around him, within whose
circle no grief or folly ventures.

Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning
this divine wanderer? You would not, if you saw him.
You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement
from the world, and you are, therefore, somewhat fastidious;
but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the
extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I
have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he
possesses, that elevates him so immeasurably above any
other person I ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive
discernment; a quick but never-failing power of judgment;
a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled
for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression,
and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing
music.
