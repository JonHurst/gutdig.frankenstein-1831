My father looked carelessly at the titlepage of my book,
and said, "Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do
not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash."

If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the
pains to explain to me, that the principles of Agrippa had
been entirely exploded, and that a modern system of science
had been introduced, which possessed much greater powers
than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical,
while those of the former were real and practical;
under such circumstances, I should certainly have thrown
Agrippa aside, and have contented my imagination, warmed
as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former
studies. It is even possible, that the train of my ideas
would never have received the fatal impulse that led to
my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken of
my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted
with its contents; and I continued to read with the greatest
avidity.

When I returned home, my first care was to procure the
whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus
and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies
of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures
known to few beside myself. I have described myself
as always having been embued with a fervent longing
to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense
labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers,
I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.
Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt
like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored
ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each
branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted,
appeared even to my boy's apprehensions, as tyros engaged
in the same pursuit.

The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him,
and was acquainted with their practical uses. The most
learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially
unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments
were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,
anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final
cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were
