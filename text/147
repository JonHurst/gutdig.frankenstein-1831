of composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of
my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.

It was after my return from one of these rambles, that
my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me:–

“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have
resumed your former pleasures, and seem to be returning to

But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong
a hold of your mind, that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,
therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation
